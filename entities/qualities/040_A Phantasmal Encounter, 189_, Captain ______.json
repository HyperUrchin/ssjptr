  "Name": "A Phantasmal Encounter, 189-, Captain ------",
  "Description": "A study of a clearing amid trees that do not grow in the Neath, of a zee-captain smashing the image of a painted serpent. The zee-captain's crew look on calmly. A forked tongue is visible in one's open mouth. The painting is tinted everywhere with viric - the greenish colour of shallow sleep, which cannot be seen on the surface of the world.\r\nYou are the zee-captain in the painting; you are also the painter."
