All this time, she has sought one none can refuse to answer. Revenge or validation? It has been so long. Even she forgets.\r\n\r\nThe words form in your head, and as you speak them the colour returns to the Fading Haruspex's cheeks. \"Thank you,\" she whispers, squeezing your hand tight. \"One more favour. Please. Take me home. I have little time left. I would spend it where I belong. I have no money, but I promise to make it worth your while.\""

Her disciples pick her up and carry her away. Their accusing eyes refuse to meet yours."
