Not in the flesh, at least.\" He leans close. \"But I once tasted red honey, and the memories of a man who had. I only saw fragments: an army at the walls, a breach, a rallying cry: 'Liberty, equality, eternity.'\"\r\n\r\nA third bottle. Where could you taste these memories for yourself?  \"Go to the Isle of Cats. Talk to the Cat's Chiefest Claw. Ask about the Far-Travelled Notary. But if you're wise, you'll do like me: use what you learn to get free drinks. Immortality's for gods and monsters.\"\r\n"
