 "Description": "$Isle of Cats -> アイル・オブ・キャッツ, Pirate-King -> 海賊王$What might one expect from Leopold, Pirate-King of the Isle of Cats: a hulking, grizzled presence with a crimson cat tattooed across his back? An oil-bearded wretch with a brace of pistols strapped to each hip, and eyes like wildfire? A gaunt-cheeked honey-seeker wasted from years of dissolution?\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aHe looks, as it turns out, more like a lawyer than a dissolute lord - though he is at least wearing a robe of patterned-silk over his dark suit. Behind him you see a wall of what you think are wine-racks. On closer inspection, the racks hold bottle upon carefully labelled bottle of red honey. ",
