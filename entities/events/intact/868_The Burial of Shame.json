Wall me up once I'm within.\"\r\n\r\nInside, you can see other casks, similar to the Cargo. A skeleton sprawls before each, or a mouldering corpse. How many times have the Chelonates buried this secret?\r\n\r\n",

Where a gap remains, you pout bonemeal into it.\r\n\r\nThe last you see of the Monk, he has laid a ragged blanket over the Cargo of Answers, and is sitting silently upon it, head bowed. The last bones grind into place. He is gone.\r\n"
