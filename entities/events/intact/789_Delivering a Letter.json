Victory at sea over screaming ships of Polythreme.

The second is for a military blunder. The Almost Dead Man was a scout, who failed to detect the approach of 'the Hyenas' - enemy reinforcements? The outcome, it seems, was catastrophic.\r\n\r\nSensitive subjects. How is this Batuk likely to take them?\r\n\r\n"

It's hard to tell which of these are frantic acts performed in the excitement of battle, and which are imagined flourishes.\r\n\r\nThe letter speaks with more than lust. It recalls Rosina's ministrations after an 'Accident', and a bone-hollowness after parting. It ends with a joke it trusts the reader to understand. You do not."
