There's a watery voice you recall from your youth. A hand, wearing a familiar ring, traces the glass.\r\n\r\nHas the whole Neath drowned while you were below? Is anyone left above the waves? You go to their airlock, place your hands on the hatch. They tremble with excitement. Outside, your friends and family and loves are waiting. You turn the wheel."
