The children have probably gone against the priest and met their match. Maybe they've been sacrificed in some dark ritual.\" She widens her eyes in mock horror. \"After all, you'd need a mind of my calibre to succeed against such a villain.\"\r\n\r\nShe seems remarkably blas√© about the children. Isn't that a little callous?\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure they're fine. He wouldn't- I'm sure they're fine.\" She smiles brightly."
