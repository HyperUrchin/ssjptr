{"ChildBranches": [{"SuccessEvent": {"Description": "Your first volley does satisfyingly grievous damage, but a half-dozen privateers snatch up weapons. One is a sort of Gatling gun. One appears to fire bubbles composed of rainbow meat. A third makes it rain in your heart. The fourth weapon explodes in a shower of fat purple sparks that chirp like canaries and chew their way through everything in the encampment - privateers, tents, loot. The battle is over before it's begun, but by the time it's safe to approach, the sparks have devoured many of the privateers' treasures...",

It conjures an appalling vibration which converts your zailors to screaming jellies. Another crouches behind a rock: she employs a kind of mortar which rains down lethal pine-cones. They smell delightful, but their perfume causes pine-needles to erupt in green masses from your ears, mouths and necks. Your crew is lost to bewildered terror: you flee as the triumphant privateers celebrate amid flares of red light.",
