After a few slips and a bad bruise to the shin, you resort to placing crew-members along the stairs and handing the box along.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThere is a warehouse at the top of the stairs, but it is not, apparently, your destination. Another sign points along the narrow path towards the building with the spire. DELIVERIES! it says, more aggressively this time.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aSomeone in the spired building is singing. The song sets your teeth on edge.",
