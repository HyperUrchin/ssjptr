You fish your pocket-watch from your vest - half past one. So where's-\r\n\r\nA footstep in the grass behind you. Someone snatches your top hat - you spring to your feet! Your friend stands there, wearing your hat. That old bastard! You chuckle, swishing your walking stick at the Jocular Gentleman. He blocks with his cane. You exchange a few bouts, as if you were still boys."
