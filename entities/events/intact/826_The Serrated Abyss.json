A bit of floating scrap, just sharp enough, slices through the flesh and exposes the soft tissue behind.\r\n\r\nYou slide your legs into the warm meat and sinew, trying not to gag on the sudden rush of blood. The muscle clamps shut around your legs and chest. It would not be hard to pull yourself out, but unlikely that you'd find yourself floating defenseless up to the scavengers above, or down into the depths of the stomach. And it is warm. Warm as a moist blanket. Against your better judgement, your eyes start to close."
