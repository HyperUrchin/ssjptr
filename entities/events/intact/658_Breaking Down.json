        "Description": "\"A bit late for being squeamish.\" The Crotchety Tobacconist shows you out of workshop. You can still hear the shouts of the Clay Man from the shop - for a while. Soon only the sharp crack of the hammer rings out. \r\n\r\nWhen they come down, the Apprentice and Tobacconist are covered in a pall of dust. The Apprentice's eyes are blood-shot, and his lashes greyed with powder. He coughs until he retches. The Tobacconist ignores him entirely. \"It'll do,\" he says, grimly. \"The flavour isn't what I'd hoped, but it must suffice. It wasn't a complete waste.\""

The Crotchety Tobacconist grabs a fistful of clay shavings from the shattered left arm. He rubs the clay into a fine powder, sniffs it, and beams. \"Oh, this is it exactly! Robust, but with a fierce bite to it. This'll get into your blood. Thank you, [q:Addressed As]. This is magnificent.\""
