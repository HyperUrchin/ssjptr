  "Description": "At the very centre of the heart, the Old Zailors sit meditating around a briny pool of gant - the colour that remains when all others are gone. Most of their clothes have rotted away to nothing or been discarded with the rest of their old lives. The oldest of them sit like statues around the pool. Thick layers of salt armour their desiccated skin.",

Now that you are amongst them, the more lucid of the Old Zailors even acknowledge your presence. You are decades younger than even their most slightly, but the Call does not discriminate."

Of the beasts of the zee and the corruption of the land. The starvation and terror that marks every trip into the dark. Here there is warmth. Safety. You are amongst your own.\r\n\r\nThe more lucid of the Old Zailors reach out. Their withered hands gently relieve you of your heavy belongings and help you out of your suffocating clothes. Their gentle hands lift you from your old life and lower you into the warmth of the Gant pool."
