Rabble-rousers, schemers, renegades. They called themselves the Seven.\" She does not sound entirely disapproving. \r\n\r\n\"My husband shielded me from the details of his endeavour, although I have made a number of suppositions. I know for certain, however, that it ended in disaster. He and his co-conspirators fled beneath the waves. If you could find him, he may be able to lead you to the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you locate him, please give him this,\" she hands you a locket containing a miniature portrait of herself. \"It is likely that he is dead, or unable to return. But if possible, I would like him to remember me.\" She takes an abrupt sip of sherry. [Search the cities under the zee for signs of Lytton, the Fierce Philanthropist's husband.]"
