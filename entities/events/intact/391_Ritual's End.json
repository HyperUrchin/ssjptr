After that someone manages to douse both flare and cloak. (Who in this crowd was carrying a bucket of water?) But it is put out, and someone's hands are clamped firm around your wrist.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the last that you see of Visage. You are taken blind back to the docks, your face covered in a black cloth that is no mask at all."
