Then comes the onslaught of a thousand nippers! Why, I only escaped thanks to a timely cloud of ink from my squid, which I befriended for precisely such an occasion.\"\r\n\r\nThe unlikely story wins the acclaim of the congregation. Whilst her rival slumps, disappointed, the Visitor waves her top hat, and processes to the bell tower. Its doors close behind her.",

The best story wins.

Wish I had a story to tell.\""
