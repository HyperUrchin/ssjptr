The tigers of the Carnelian Coast might not be considered obvious candidates, but they are intimately familiar with the natural perils and resources of the Elder Continent. They are also unfailingly polite, and play a competent hand of bridge if someone manages the cards for them. \r\n\r\nTheir ruler is the Banded Prince.",

        "Description": "A footman in a magnificently striped uniform leads you to your audience. The Prince is in a dangerous mood. He lounges on the old Governor's desk, flicking his tail impatiently. But he remembers his debts. The footman returns with Madeira cake for you, and the carcass of one of the bristly pigs of the fungal jungle for His Highness.\r\n\r\nAs you eat, you note how his ears twitch with irritation, and how he growls at a bat that flits by the window. He is bored. You take your chance. The Prince stops eating to listen to your proposal. \"Yes,\" he says, before you are done. \"Yes; a thousand times yes. I will join your Seven, and war upon Nidah.\"\r\n\r\nThe taste of true princehood has whetted his appetite. Now he would be king."

Together, you sit atop the gargantuan mushroom, and watch the Mountain's glow illuminate the South. You explain your intention to seize immortality from the Nidaheen.\r\n\r\nThe Prince ponders. \"Here, my people are unwelcome in our own land. If I help you take Nidah, my price is this: a new kingdom on the bright slopes of the Mountain. Where we can bask and roam eternally.\"\r\n\r\nYou agree, and the Banded Prince nods his heavy head. \"Then you have another of your Seven.\""
