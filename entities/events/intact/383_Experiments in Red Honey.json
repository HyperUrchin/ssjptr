  "Description": "The next time you are summoned to see your Patron, it is not in their offices at the Honeyed Tongue. Instead you find yourself in a well-lit laboratory of book-lined walls and delicate equipment. Isery does not pause in their task of pouring red honey into a cucurbit flask.\r\n\r\n\"It is possible to encourage lamplighter bees to seek out one kind of memory over another,\" they announce, without any preamble. \"It's all about what you expose the bee to, once it has drunk the maddening nectar of the crimson roses. But it is an uncertain process. Full of guesswork. The Alarming Scholar and I have been trying to... apply the scientific method, you could say.\"\r\n\r\nThey look fond for a moment, soft. \"I require you to perform a little experiment for me. Shouldn't take long.\"",
