        "Description": "Of course, there's no way that you could actually <i>hear</i> the shouts. Not through the airlock, the hull, the yards of water. Never mind the crew members who swore that they could hear every shriek and whimper of the divers you sent out into the corpse-water. And besides, from what you saw, there wasn't time for screaming. The dark slick gathered around their diving-suits, enfolding them like a cloak. You glimpsed one terror-contorted face through the glass of their helmet as they were bundled up in darkness, and then it was over. Only a little flotsam remained; the water was clear, as though the Neither had never been."

        "Description": "Your ship's lamps sparked strange twinkles in the spreading remains of the Neither. When you looked closer, within the blackness you could see an unfamiliar sky, grasping trees, the cries of hostile birds. But now only clear water remains. The battle is over, isn't it? Of course. In any case, the thing is dead. Yes. You tear yourself from the porthole."
