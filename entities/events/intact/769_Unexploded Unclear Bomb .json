        "Description": "You approach the copper bulk of the bomb, fighting against a persistent current. Pulling yourself across its surface, you look for a way to access its valuable interior. Here: a panel. You try to pry it off. The device shudders. An expulsion of silent blackness engulfs you.\r\n\r\nIt devours the light of your ship's beams like a glutton at Sunday dinner. In an instant it kills every lamp on board, every filament-bulb. A passing school of pilot fish are extinguished. Your panicking crew winch you back aboard, and you flee through the pitch dark until your lights begin, limply, to return."
