Even an unsouled forest-monkey can steal a soul and almost never cause lasting harm to the victim. Donor. He means donor. Of course.\r\n\r\nLater, you awaken under rags, bruised, with a headache and feeling of loss. It is done. Your mind licks at the strange emptiness as a tongue might a missing tooth."
