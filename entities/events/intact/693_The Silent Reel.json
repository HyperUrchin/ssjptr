The great chain of dancers weaves through the crowd without a noise. There are formerly holy teachers; once monarchs; warriors without battles; short-changed merchants - a growing and ceaseless parade. Some move with grace, others only sway in their steps out of obligation. The spool continues to unreel."

There is a modest bang, and the air fills with fluttering papers. On each, a resident of Hideaway has written their secret. The dancers fall on them in a frenzy. You snatch as many as you can.\r\n\r\nThe one whose mercy led to colonial establishment. The seller of names. The one whose theories on Is-Not proved too dangerous. The one who stormed the city - what's this? The name is too smudged to read."

The Master clears his throat, and signs - with trembling hands - the closing of the festival. He thanks the people of Hideaway for the celebration of unity, and thanks Temtum for their home. The crowd responds with silent applause. Here and there, you spot a few thanking you with secretive smiles. One even pushes something into your hand: a small token of thanks."
