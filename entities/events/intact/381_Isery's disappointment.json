  "Description": "Isery is waiting on the docks when you next arrive at Port Cavendish. Behind them are a pair of courtesans with arms folded forbiddingly. It appears they know that you have returned empty-handed. \r\n\r\n\"I hoped, I really did, that you wouldn't place me in this awkward predicament.\" Isery clasps their claw-jewelled hands to their delicately featured face. \"I do so dislike having to make examples of people. It's so <i>messy</i>.\"",

        "Description": "You are, regrettably, mistaken. The courtesans are corded with muscle under their gauzy silks, and slit the throats of two of your crew as an opening gambit. The rest of the crew - quite wisely - cowers back. You drag your eyes from the corpses just in time to see Isery very calmly claw you across the face. You dream shivering dreams of claws of enamel and bone for several nights after, and count yourself lucky."
