Unbidden, the sorrow-spider on his shoulder crawls across his face, stabbing one leg into each with a squelch. Just for a moment, the Emissary's face flickers with the euphoria of a new disciple of prisoner's honey, but only for as long as it takes to shiver. His normal, polite countenance returns as the cart rolls onto the webbed bridge, taking you high above the black zee."
