        "Description": "You take a deep breath of bittersweet incense and recount your tales. As you speak, a chronicler carves your words onto bricks of ash and bone powder. The bone quill's scratching grates and the incense stings your eyes, but you continue.\r\n\r\nBy the time you've finished, your head aches and the chronicler holds a handful of bricks. Before returning to your ship, you examine one. It bears your name and a short tale. \r\n\r\nBut it isn't a memory of yours. You'd remember anything that outlandish. Best to leave before they realise the mistake they've made."

The scratching of the bone quill grows louder in your ears with every word.\r\n\r\nBy the time you've finished, your trophy has been replaced with an identical copy. But this one has been inscribed with a thrilling, fictional tale. As you depart, you wonder if you would recognise the hero of such a thrilling yarn."

Each one bears a name and a tale, but you can't pause to read them all. One by one, you carry the bricks across the room, stacking them neatly into a wall. \r\n\r\nThe work is slow, and the air thick with bittersweet incense. Each brick is heavier than the last, and the work becomes a blur. Sweat beads and trickles down your back. Running down your face. Soaking through your clothes. Drowning you in salt.\r\n\r\nYou awake from the dream with a start. You are clean and dry, lying in an unfamiliar room. You pull yourself out of bed with great effort and leave the grey-bricked house behind."

When you've made yourself comfortable, she hands you her bone quill and asks you to write the names of your crew.\r\n\r\nThe quill is clumsy in your hand as you write. After the third name, it slips from your grasp, pricking your finger. Gripping it tighter, the sharp edges press into your flesh. Blood runs down its length and pools on the page. You feel a pang of guilt for ruining the vellum, but it passes as the names continue. \r\n\r\nYou wake up with a start. The paper is covered in ash. It doesn't matter. You leave without looking back."
