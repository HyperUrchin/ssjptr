Splendid...\"\r\n\r\nHe leans in close. \"My benefactors have charged me with seeking... a special sustenance for a special occasion. I am sure an experienced zailor such as yourself sees through the necessary euphemism. Shall we say, unfortunates of little future, such as your tomb-colonists? Were perhaps a select few to find a different destination for the greater good, I can promise more than fair compensation for any subsequent regrets.\" [You may be able to obtain trusting tomb-colonist tourists at Venderbight, if you've assisted them in the past.]"
