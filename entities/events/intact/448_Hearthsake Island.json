But I can't find an X anywhere.\" He looks at the map sadly. \"It should be here, it says. Now where am I supposed to dig?\"\r\n\r\nHe is too busy to talk right now, but adds that he will be in the village later if you want to trade adventuring supplies. \"Don't try the meatballs,\" he warns, getting back to his search. \"You just... don't want to do that.\""

WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST THE THIEVING LITTLE BUGGERS TO GO SHAVING ONE OF THEIR OWN! WOULDN'T KNOW FAIR PLAY IF IT KICKED 'EM UP RIGHT UP THE ARSE!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice is louder than his blunderbuss. The congealed meat juices in his thick beard are better not considered."
