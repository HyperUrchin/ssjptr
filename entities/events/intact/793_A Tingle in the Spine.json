You enter the barn, and throw yourself into the hay. The owls are quiet tonight. Maybe the warmth of the day has them tired, too. The Vibrant Lady isn't tired, though. You grin as she opens the barn door, and stands full lit in the light of the moon.\r\n\r\nYou wake in a dank warehouse, atop an old sack of mushrooms. Your pockets are lighter; someone has robbed you in your sleep."

You're hungry. You check your pocket watch - Heavens! If you're late for dinner, that old codger won't let you forget it for a week.\r\n\r\nYou arrive wheezing, but on time. The Jocular Gentleman joins you shortly after, and jokes about your ruddy complexion. You place your orders, and excuse yourself to the lavatory.\r\n \r\nWhen you return, you find two pots of squid stew gurgling on your empty table. They smell foul. The establishment is moulding; the bill is unreasonable."

Amber aurora-light glints in her goggles. \"Get me some of them crackers.

Your bag of Rubbery Lumps has spilled onto the floor. An irritated big wheel operator is prodding you. \"You've had your turn. <i>Out.</i>\" "
