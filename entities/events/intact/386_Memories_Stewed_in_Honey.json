Her father threatened to break your legs if you so much as looked at her, but you cannot help yourself. Her hands are softer than anything you have ever imagined, and dappled in warm sunlight. The curve of her smile slices into you like a blade - \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aYou come back to yourself in a sudden rush. You are lying on the floor alone, your face wet with stolen tears. On the desk: a Key to the Cage Gardens, which you slip into your pocket, and a gold statuette of a tiger, with eyes of polished ruby. Something about the statuette makes you decidedly uneasy. Still, it will probably sell for a good price.",
