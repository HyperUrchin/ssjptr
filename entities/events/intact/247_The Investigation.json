Should have already shed its shell, but I guess it's willing itself to hold on. It can't beat biology though, can it! It's going to outgrow Hideaway. Soon.\" He drags himself from the bed. \"Everyone here needs to know. They need to leave. I'll compile my notes, and then we must tell them. Please, [q:Addressed As] - they won't listen to me. They dislike me. But if you said something...?\""

We'll use their hatch to study the the shell's inside.\"\r\n\r\nOne after another, you splash into the dark. With your light, you can see the flesh of the beast beneath you. It is bruised; bloodied, in some places. In others, it's mere feet from the shell. The Investigator points ahead, to a thick cable, hanging down from above. As it comes more clearly into view, it sparks. The charge results in a twitching of Temtum's flesh. You return to the city as swiftly as you can, but your crew is caught by Temtum's shifting body, and crushed between his shell and his flesh. As soon as you're back in Hideaway, the Investigator strips out of his diving suit and flees. "
