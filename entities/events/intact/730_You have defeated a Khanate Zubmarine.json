The Khanate zubmarine fares far worse - its metal skin tears like paper from fore to aft. Then an explosion! From the observation dome, you watch as the Khanate crew is destroyed in fire and water. The water stills. Ship parts and crew sink slowly downwards."

        "Description": "You swim through a rip near the back of the Khanate zubmarine. Some of the crew quarters survive - although fire-blasted, and creaking. The Khanate crew had lived in confined luxury - a dozen beds are bolted to the floor. The chamber's walls are copper, the roof indigo-domed, the floor is lacquered. The zubmarine's supplies and everything else of value were destroyed by your guns. On your return, your navigator mentions seeing a small craft departing from the wreck, climbing slowly towards the light."
