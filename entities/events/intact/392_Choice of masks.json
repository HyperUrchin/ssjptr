The Frog is for visitors who, though perhaps clumsy and unfamiliar with local etiquette, have come in order to observe local ways and to make uncouth comments about them. \r\n\r\nThe Locust is for those who seek profit in Visage and would carry away as many goods as possible.\r\n\r\nYou prompt about the Bat. Moon Moth hesitates. \"Bat is an ill-omened visitor. Sent as a messenger or a spy. Bat always dies.\""

These improve your view of the environment, though you must look bulb-eyed from the outside. There is also a mechanism attached to the mouth piece which magnifies any sounds you make, even your breathing. You start to thank the Moon-Moth and it comes out as a booming croak.\r\n\r\n\"May you profit from your visit in knowledge,\" says Moon-Moth. Its wings fold neatly over its back."
