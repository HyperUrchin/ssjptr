The ancient webs catch fire instantly, spreading quickly as the screams of the captives join those of the Weavers and Widows and the burning spider-council in a cacophony of pain and anger and fury and gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe sorrow-spiders surge as one, tearing your flesh into ribbons as you flail helplessly towards the cliffside in a cloak of legs and fangs. The black zee embraces you, salting the wounds until unconsciousness beckons. If you're lucky, you'll be fished out by a friendly face. For now, there is only the memory of a nightmare not yet escaped."
