Now, precisely now, you choose to see things as they are: the strained hope on its still-lovely face; the beetroot, prehensile anatomy below. \r\n\r\nSeeing that you are no longer in thrall, your lover pulls a floating silk across its thighs. \"No one has woken in the middle before,\" it says. And: \"It wasn't a lie, but a different seeing.\" Then it withdraws from you, shaking and unsteady. On a rock it deposits a pile of coral-coloured eggs."

But yes, it is capable, and urgent also.\r\n\r\nAfter, you do up the buttons on your lover's back, and brush away the tiny silver scales that glitter on your hip. "

'Oh, my beloved has gone to Dahut, and I must rescue her!' If that's what you wanted, you could have just asked, but this way you have an excuse for dallying with a Drownie first. What will you tell her? 'I didn't want to, dearest, and it gave me a shudder to do it, but I had to, just to get you back.'\"\r\n\r\nYou open your mouth, but your lover isn't finished. \"You people say we're liars and deceivers, but we're only giving a little extra colour to what's already in your mind. You wanted to be here, whatever you tell yourself. And so does she! If someone is in prison in Dahut, it's her own doing. The walls are only there if you have a mind to view them.\""
