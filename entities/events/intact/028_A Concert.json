They set up on a dark beach lit by torches on poles, and do eight folk-songs, a mischievous music-hall number called The Empress Likes Them Quiet, and an odd restless little tune like a caged cat. \"My own composition,\" the Washman confides.\r\n\r\nHonestly, they're not very good. They are unrehearsed and uneven, and the presence of something serpentine in the surf puts them off. But those homely sounds here on the deep's doorstep - something about it lifts the heart."
