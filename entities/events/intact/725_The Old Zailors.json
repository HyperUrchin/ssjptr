For many it began on the Surface, long before the Cumaean Canal made travel to the Neath so convenient or seemingly possible. Yet still they found their way here. All the old beasts of every zee know where to die."

A life of weariness tugs at your eyelids, and soon there is only blackness with a silver aftertaste.\r\n\r\nSome time later, you awaken far from the Old Zailors, in a previously unexplored ventricle. Hours later. Perhaps days. The cold air of the Gant Pole prickles your bare skin. Your fingertips burn. Handwritten text glimmers in the darkness, not all of it legible. A tale of a Heart torn from its owner. A melancholy that calls to those whose stories are over and grants them an end."

The oldest have few coherent memories left, save a shared one of a crossroads shaded by cedars. "
