  "Description": "The Replete occupy lofty positions in the Presbyterate's military. Despite their sanguinary past, they dine with the Prester and send their children to be educated at London's University. However, they maintain their tradition of eating their dead.\r\n\r\nThe feasts are held in public. Here in a broad square stretches a splendid table. The departed was only a distant relative - some great-aunt or second cousin - and the atmosphere is jolly. Servants carry the deceased over in steaming joints, cooked to perfect pinkness. A stately mourner stands, already wobbly from wine. \"Shall I carve?\" ",

Still, I bet the Prester finds them useful. The threat of imminent cannibalism must facilitate no end of diplomatic negotiations.\" \r\n\r\nA salt-cellar passes along the table. Napkins dab at mouth-corners. The anthropologist is warming to her subject. \"I hear the practice began with one of their forebears who zailed into the far North. I may have to take a trip that way. See what it's like for myself.\""
