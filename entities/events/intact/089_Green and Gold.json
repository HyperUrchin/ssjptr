The zee around us will brighten further: forest-green, grass-green, green-and-gold. Mountains will rise ahead of us, flecked with light, their slopes veiled in forest. Mist will stream upwards from the zee. The beaches of that land ahead will be limned in silver like the painted moon. Our ship will beach, flawlessly and whole. She will never turn her prow homewards. I will sift the sand through my fist. I will lift my eyes to where the mountains rise, the loom and lilt of them, the sky where I will go. Salt is smiling.",
