I will not deceive you - I mean to take the bulk of the credit as this was, predominantly, an endeavour of my own invention. But I am not ungrateful! Here is a sum of moneys. Here are necessaries for your next excursion. Here are some peculiar fruit, what I do not otherwise know what to do with.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the rumours race around London: the Cheery Man is dead. Choked on his dinner, they say. It's a surprise then, when you receive an invitation to drink with the Cheery Man at the Medusa's Head."

In fact - remind me again how precisely to spell your name.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, you receive an invitation from the Cheery Man. He wants you to join him for drinks."
