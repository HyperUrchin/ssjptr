Their tentacles whip menacingly as they advance - but the cockatoo says something to give them pause. You strain your ears to hear. Fragments of screeched poetry from your pet vie with the shrill fluting of the blemmigans... are they reciting poetry too? Is this a competition? A greeting?\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aAbruptly, your Cockatoo rises, and returns to sit on your shoulder. It preens delightedly and delivers four lines of perfect decasyllabic quatrain on 'those thousand shapes of unforgiven Time'.
