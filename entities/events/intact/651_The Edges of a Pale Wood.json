        "Description": "As you crossed a dusty stream, a flock of birds waddled from the water. Their necks were as sinuous as swans', but their bodies were as fat and flippered as a penguin. They clattered their long, narrow beaks at you. \r\n\r\n\"These are the edges of the wood,\" the Poet explained. \"We will keep to them. The things in its heart are older, and never learned to fear us.\" \r\n\r\nThe amber sun never set on your journey, though you grew tired, and rested, and travelled again. At last, a black cliff rose. At the foot of the cliff was a cave, and before the cave a fire burned. Its flames were white and wan. The Poet hurried forward, to join the people sat around it."

Yours are from after: the flutter of bats about the chimneys, the flickering glow of the Bazaar-sigils, the schemes of the Masters.\r\n\r\nAfterward, he strokes his beginnings of a beard. \"Times change, eh? There's no going back, of course. But there's sometimes new beginnings.\" He gives you a smile of crooked teeth."

The water was bitter, washing away the sweetness of the honey. \r\n\r\nYou wake, with a start, in the Once-Great Poet's chambers. Your mouth is full. Snatching an empty wine bottle from beside the chair, you spit a measure of silvery liquid into it. The Cheery Man's medicine. Back to London!"
