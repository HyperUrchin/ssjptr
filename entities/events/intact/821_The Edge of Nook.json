It soon becomes obvious that you are over-dressed for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe people of Nook swim and breathe in the cloudy Maw-water with no apparent discomfort. Most are naked, with just a few clad in rotten rags that stream from their skin with no concern for modesty.\r\n\r\nNone will communicate with you, if they even can. Those who acknowledge your presence just laugh silently at your bulky suit and unnecessary air-hose. You'll need a different approach."

Your lungs burn, holding in that last gulp of air; your legs thrash. You can't hold it in. It escapes! You're choking on water. It forces its way into your lungs, the taste of burning salt suffocating every attempt to gasp, scream or-\r\n\r\nThen, through the exhaustion and panic, you realise you're breathing. It's hard work. Your lungs fight against the weight. But it's enough. You can tolerate it, at least for now.\r\n[The liberal application of wine will make this process easier - in future, bring a cask.]"
