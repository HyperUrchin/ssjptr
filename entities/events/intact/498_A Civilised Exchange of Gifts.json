        "Description": "Wholesale souls? Do you take them for savages? Devils? Your pitiful charity is utterly rejected, with a slam of clenched paw on table. Outside these walls, yes, their brethren may thirst for any random soul. Inside however only the finest alchemy will suffice - refined, distilled, perfected. How <i>dare</i> you think anything else? No! Take your tuppence-a-soul rejects and begone!"

His words alone transport you into another world, through a veil of sad tears and out into a reality that feels somewhat warmer. At the mandarin's nod, he leaves signed copies of his work behind. A gift, for one of a land where such stories are prized and properly appreciated."
