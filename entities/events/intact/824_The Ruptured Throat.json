Many have nothing, and nothing to lose.\r\n\r\nA group of swimmers dart past, hunting gleefully. One squeezes your shoulder, companionably. You've never met her before."

The slightly glutinous water makes speech impossible, so the natives have developed a language of signs. You can interpret the most basic: a finger pulled across a throat, for example, is one of the more polite invitations to depart."
