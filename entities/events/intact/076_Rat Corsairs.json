But now a sudden flood of black and white fur confronts you: a starving torrent of rattus faber corsairs! Their chief addresses you in a piping unhuman voice: \"Easy there, me giants! We're in dire need, here. Lend us help, and we'll pay well for it. No need to fight.\" (But you notice his rat-hand is on the hilt of his rat-cutlass.)",

Its mouth drips crimson: its eyes blaze yellow. At last you stand triumphant, and the rats are fled or dead. You draw a string of drowning-pearls from the weskit of the rat-captain. His eyes are already filming with death, but he hisses savagely \"To the Seven Cats with yer...\"\r\n\r\nA single zailor is dead. His throat has been torn from ear to ear. It doesn't look like a rat-bite. You glance at the Mog. It is washing its face with a casual paw."
