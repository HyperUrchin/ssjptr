        "Description": "The hungry school ignores your torpedoes. Explosions blow apart their orderly ranks but more fish-teeth swim to replenish their ranks. Again and again, your zubmarine is savaged as they throw themselves against your hull. burrowing suicidally into the metal. As you watch, one of the pearly fish bursts through a porthole and buries itself in a zailor's neck.\r\n\r\nYou beat a panicked retreat and the tide of teeth loses interest as your zubmarine limps away. When you lay out the dead zailor, you can still see the shape of the tooth-fish wriggling beneath his skin."

You flee the eyeless school at full speed, leaking from a half-dozen punctures in your shell-hull, each no larger than a sardine. A thin filament stretches from each away into the dark towards a single point, quickly severed as your engines pull you away.\r\n\r\nFalling further and further behind you, the school turns its attention to other prey. The teaming mass surrounds a passing shark, bludgeoning it to cloudy paste."
