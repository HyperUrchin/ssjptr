The click of a sliding stone where there should be silence - a motion in the shadows, as if they were thick-stirred like ink - a lull in the cries of the zee-bats. Something is watching you, drawing closer hour by hour. You and your crew draw back to back, watching the darkness.",

        "Description": "One of your crew strays too far from the group. You never know why - you don't know it's happened until you hear him cry out. As your crew rushes to assist, there's another cry from behind you. Another zailor vanishes into the darkness! You glimpse a writhing coil of limbs and the glitter of eyes, and the beast is gone. The beasts. There must be at least two of them. Who knows how many more?\r\n\r\nYou retreat with haste to the ship, eyes wide, though you see nothing more of the predators. Perhaps their hunger is satisfied."

One of your zailors steps into her own pit trap, and another backs off the cliff trying to do something elaborate with a rope. You see nothing more of the beast, but your wretched crew is proving to be more of a danger anyway. Back to the ship."
