This straight-backed, many-legged edifice is perhaps a chair. That oily surface - a table? An altar?\r\n\r\nThe breeze, winter-cold, enters through an arched window. Through it, you can see a dark sky. \r\n\r\nThe sun is black. It <i>squirms</i>.",

        "Description": "The creature is towering, bulky, and unevenly-shaped beneath its fluttering veils. It carries what looks like a measuring rod, notched with unfamiliar enumerations. Its voice is shrill. \"Welcome, Trespasser, to the House of Rods and Chains. Your daring is notable, and rare. My employer -\" here, the thing extends what is hopefully an arm towards the window, and the sable, seething sun, \"- would like you to deliver a message to the Neath. You will be compensated.\"\r\n\r\nIt shuffles towards the table-altar. A set of iridescent scales stand there, the bowls perfectly balanced. One bowl holds a bubble of glass, in which something bright and misty coils. The other bowl is empty."

        "Description": "\"Please,\" the creature squeals, inclining its upper portions towards the scales. You take the glass bubble. The wisp inside it peers madly out with pinprick eyes. The black sun is closer, now, glaring into the chamber like a child through a dollhouse window.\r\n\r\nPain blooms behind your left temple. It migrates: across your cheek, down your neck, over your shoulder. You clutch at it, and feel a sliding, swelling pucker on your skin before it moves out of reach.\r\n\r\n\"The Liberation of Night began long ago,\" the veiled creature pipes. \"Tell whoever you choose, or do not. You are the message. Those who must know, will know.\" It bangs its measuring-rod on the floor. The sun screams in joy. Everything goes dark.\r\n\r\nYou find yourself back in your zubmarine, your crew desperately steering it away from the vast eye on the zee-bed. Your pain is easing, but not gone. You stumble wildly to your quarters. A mirror. You need a mirror!\r\n\r\n"
