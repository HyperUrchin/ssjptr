        "Description": "In the zub's tight hallways, your mutinous crew can only attack you one at a time. The first loses her ear, the next an eye. The third loses their left hand; the fourth their right. \r\n\r\nThe ship tilts into a dive. More crewmen fall in their turn, until you are too few and too wounded to save your sinking vessel. A chasm yawns in the zee bed. It claims your ship before the mutineers can."

But your stirring speech is interrupted by an explosion from the engine room. Rushing water drowns out your eloquence. In short order it drowns everything else, as well."
