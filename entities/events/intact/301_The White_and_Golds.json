        "Description": "They're almost on you! In a fit of desperation, you dive through an open manhole into the elaborate sewers of the Heart. The White-and-Golds pursue you even there, but the cleanliness of their uniform disinclines them to search as carefully as they might.\r\n\r\nStill, it is a full two days before you dare emerge. In the meantime you've fought rat-crab hybrids, hidden trembling from maintenance teams, and feasted on the grimmest and slimmest of pickings. When you creep back to the docks, your crew are all but ready to sail without you. Their relief on seeing you is tempered by the appalling state of your person. [Next time, it might go worse still for you. Visit Khan's Glory and plead with the Taimen Clan for mercy before you return here.]"
