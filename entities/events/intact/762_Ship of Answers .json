        "Description": "The inscriptions have been filled with the paste of fungal spores. These luminesce, rendering the words clear in the dark. The writing tells of a passenger obtained; a jilly-stung Chelonate hunter. It describes how he insisted that he be allowed into the cargo hold. Of a pitched battle that ensued when he wasn't. Dried stains underfoot tell the rest. The hold remains secure. \r\n\r\nBreaking it open, you discover a box of bone carvings providing an description of the Chelonate's great turtle and an account of its death. It was not hunted, the carvings claim, only <i>discovered</i>, already dead and rotting. [You could deliver the bone carvings to Scrimshander.]"

Each bone has been split, and hollowed out - so that both inside and out could be inscribed. \r\n\r\nSome of the bones are dated - the first in each skeleton. It appears the crew were chosen for scrivening one at a time. There is something legible on the right ulnar of an otherwise unmarked skeleton: <i>Scrimshander.</i> "
