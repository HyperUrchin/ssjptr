Before they recover, bowls of peligin soup are set before them. <i>\"Swallowed!\"</i> the Poissonnier intones. The taste is deep and rich and heavy, lining the stomach. Several drownies lift the bowls to their lips to catch the last drops.\r\n\r\nA merciful interlude follows. <i>The Surface, High Above</i> is a mild, palate-cleansing mousse. Afterwards comes <i>Lost Breath</i> - a roulade of still-wriggling tentacles; bitter on the tongue's tip, but departing with a long, mellow aftertaste as it slides down the throat. The penultimate course <i>The Abandonment of the Self</i> is spun with sugar and crunchy with salt. Spherical cages of solidified syrup, containing fiery sweetmeats. The filigree cracks between Drownie teeth. The sweetmeats vanish down damp gullets.\r\n\r\nLast of all, <i>The Promise of What is to Follow</i> - a brûléed cream of inexplicable pungency - indescribably more-ish. The diners lean back, bloated. When their senses return, they call for the Poissonnier and congratulate him upon impeccably reproducing the sensation of drowning in culinary form. \"It was not drowning,\" the Fathomking says, his baritone rolling over their babble. \"It was love.\" He raises his glass to the Poissonnier.
