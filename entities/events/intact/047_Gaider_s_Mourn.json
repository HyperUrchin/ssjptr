 "Description": "The Mourn is a stalagmite vast as a crag, and its foot has no safe harbours. The corsair's citadel nestles halfway up. An intricate system of winches takes the strain... and your ship rises slowly from the zee. Her hull creaks in protest. Grizzled zailors groan and cling to stanchions.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aHigher, higher. Now the Unterzee shimmers like glass below. Children clambering in crevices cheer and wave alarmingly. The winch-motor slows, and you hang in a cradle next to a red-bowed pirate cutter.",
