A string of painters belonging to the Nocturnal movement pour from visiting ships, determined to capture the ghostly, pastel splendour of the fungal jungle. British flags flutter over every house in the colony. People sing the national anthem in public houses, and mean it. The colony has changed. \"Little London\" they call it.

The owner of the <i>Specularum</i>, the colony's biggest theatre, who decides what people laugh at. A cabal of foremen at the sapphire mines.\r\n\r\nSoon the tea-shop grumblings have taken a rebellious tone. The Khan's favourite play, <i>The Dauntless Trimaran</i> opens to effusive reviews. A sudden craze for airag sweeps the port, and every public house smells of fermented milk. [Increase your Network to 7 to decide Port Carnelian's fate permanently.]"

You form a Restitution Committee, soothing tigerish egos by giving every member a splendid title. \"Any other business?\" demands the Over-Secretary in Charge of Cultural Conspiracy at the first meeting. One of your agents scribbles terrified minutes.\r\n\r\nTheir first act is to organise a march protesting the practice of separate theatre performances for tigers and humans. They can't carry placards and can't agree on slogans, but their roars rattle every window in the colony. [Increase your Network to 7 to decide Port Carnelian's fate permanently.]"

Beneath the waves, in the gulping, peligin depths, slides the <i>Irrepressible</i>, the Admiralty's vehemently denied experimental zubmarine. Let the Khan keep sending his ships.

The White-and-Golds walk the streets of the colony, glancing narrowly left and right. The tea is served without milk, now. The street signs are written in Khaganian characters first, and Roman ones second. The work of the sapphire mines is not interrupted even for a moment, but the tightly nailed boxes that emerge sail north, now, not west."

It turns out that if you put someone in a room with a tiger, they will agree to anything.\r\n\r\nYour agents ensure no doors are locked, and that the garrison has rifles and bullets, but no firing pins. Hapless guards flee as the Banded Prince pads into Heartscross House. You watch the Governor sign the colony over to its original inhabitants. The Prince and his confidants are discussing condiments. The Governor's pen trembles.\r\n\r\nThe humans who weren't members of Her Majesty's Foreign Office are permitted to stay. The tigers have grown accustomed to the advantages provided by thumbs and fingers."
