And take off that ridiculous getup.\" The Deductress frowns. \"This certainly is not your finest work. And why did you have to involve children? You know I hate that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't have converted my Nerveless if I could only promise them hard work.\" The Hempen Man is ignoring you entirely. \"Look Mina - I can save this city. The people needn't live in a gulping monster. I can do something <i>good</i> for once.\" He darts backwards towards the wound, swimming like a Nooker. \"You shan't stop me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What - you can't!\" the Deductress cries, aghast. \"<i>I'm</i> the hero!
