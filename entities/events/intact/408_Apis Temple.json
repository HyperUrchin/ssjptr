        "Description": "The question displeases the priests. How ill-omened, even to suggest that the bull might die!\r\n\r\nIf it does die, of course (says one in an aside), there will be another born with the same markings, if not on Visage itself, then somewhere around the Unterzee. Apis is never gone, but sometimes his spirit goes astray. \r\n\r\nTo show you the sort of markings they mean, they lift its tongue, and show you the jewel-coloured scarab on the underside. It looks more like a tattoo than a birthmark.\r\n\r\nThe bull rolls its eyes and pulls its head away."
