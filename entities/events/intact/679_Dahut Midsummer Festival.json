The shapes in the water aren't even fully visible, but they are not human, and they do not worship you. They are, at best, indifferent.\r\n\r\nTheir dance is sincere in its fashion, however. They celebrate the fruits of the sea. They welcome the newly drowned. They look forward to a day when Dahut is as large and as populous as Paris or London, with streets and streets of wrecked vessels and lost cargoes."
