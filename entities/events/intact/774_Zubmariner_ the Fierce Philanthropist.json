She wears sensible satins and sensible shoes. Her hair is impeccably curled.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard a number of shocking things about you, [q:Addressed As], all of which I consider thoroughly promising.\" Her accent has a hint of Midlands melancholy to it. She must have spent much of her life on the Surface.\r\n\r\nFor a time, she asks questions about your travels and listens avidly to your answers. Then she gets down to business."
