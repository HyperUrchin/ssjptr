  "Description": "The Delightful Adventuress leans over the rail of the ship, sniffing the humid air with evident distaste. \"What a filthy, damp little place. Oh well, we shall endure.\"\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the Mayor hobbling up, she straightens. A thin, insincere smile spreads across her face. \"Ah! You there! My good primitive!\" she calls, striding down the ramp and clasping his arm tight. \"Now then, I come in search of your First Emperor's Vault, and for that I shall be needing a few things. Some of your finest workers, and tools, and some food. Do you understand me?\"\r\n\r\nShe shakes her head, barely waiting for a response. \"F-o-o-d,\" she repeats. \"<i>Komprenas?</i> Oh dear, I see we shall be here for a while. Listen, I hear you fellows rather like souls. Shall we discuss that like higher primates?\"",

        "Description": "Barnabas removes his mask with what looks to be a silent moment of great relief. Underneath is... nothing, just a flat surface where his face should have been. Ah. An <i>Unfinished</i> Clay Man: one of those flawed products of Polythreme that follow their own rules. If only you'd known that before he boarded. Of course, that's why the Adventuress never mentioned it.\r\n\r\nHe silently presents you with your agreed fee, dips his head in a polite bow, and lumbers back to his mistress. It appears she has struck a deal with the Mayor. [The Delightful Adventuress will establish a basecamp on Fountainhead Island. She welcomes your assistance, as one who has proven to be not entirely useless.]"
