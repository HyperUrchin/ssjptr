At last, with a groan, a snap, and a spray of viridian blood, a fragment of spindly limb comes free. Suited divers rivet the forelimb to your shell-hull. And what's this? The Companion was clutching something..."

Confined in an armoured diving suit, you hack clumsily at an exposed pedipalp. While you work, its long hairs brush gently, almost lovingly, against your suit. Your zubmarine is primed to make a hasty escape as soon as you return with your trophy."

        "Description": "It takes a pry-bar and a pickaxe to detach a grub from the bulbous hulk of its mother. It emits a constant, irritating noise - like the whine of a wasp trapped in honey, amplified and prolonged. Eventually, one of the small grubs pops free. Once on board the ship, the curled, yellow mass wriggles and squeals, before whitening and falling still. A crewman tentatively approaches. The grub writhes to life, burrowing into him hungrily. By the time you are able to separate them, both crewman and grub are dead. "
