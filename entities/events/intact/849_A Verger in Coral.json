It was a good scheme. Bourdain recruited our legions. Lorenzo charted our path. Arik sailed our troops up the red river on living ships. Batuk led our armies. Rosina healed our wounds.\r\n\r\n\"After our defeat, we were separated. I don't know where the others hide, except one: Mariam, who gathered us. She was a princess of the Presbyterate. Look for her deep in Scrimshander, in the Stygian Repository. Where the white bones turn black.\" He takes a last look at the locket from his wife, then clicks it closed. \"Give her this, so she knows I sent you.\" [To advance your ambition, locate the Stygian Repository in Scrimshander.]"
