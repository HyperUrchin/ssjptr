Its pale radiance grows in strength as the flesh sloughs away. It is like the last moments of a near-spent candle. In an instant, the zee is dark. As your crew turn to return, one fights to stay among the last of the luminescence. Your crew return without her: \"Went for my airline. Wasn't worth the risk.\" "
