Their eye sockets and jaws have been caulked closed with something resinous. Your diving gear is awkward. Your foot disturbs a skull; it rolls on its side, and you see it's sealed underneath. \r\n\r\nA cracking sound. The skull rocks, this time without your help. Another dull crack. Its parietal bone breaks, drifts away. From inside something uncoils, black and glistening, centipedal, trimmed with writhing cilia. It gropes towards you, unwinding to shoulder height - how did all that fit inside a skull?\r\n\r\nAnother crack from behind you. Another. You flee, as the skulls begin to hatch."
