  "Description": "A tall tooth has been carved into a spiralled cone. It is ringed with delicate patterns, each band representing a stratum of Nook society. It is an honest depiction of the population. The lowest band is oppressively intricate, with hooks and blades gouged into its design. The pinnacle is unmarred and highly polished. The elite find life smooth-living, here. \r\n\r\nToday the shrine seems popular. Is this piety caused by the constant shaking of the ground, or are the Nookers a devout group?",

        "Description": "\"Our ancestors entered the Maw fleeing tyranny, with nothing but the sacred knives they held in their teeth. Their enemies left them to their fates, assuming that none could survive in this deepest, darkest, sharpest of crevices. Yet, here in the mouth of providence, they prospered, and we continue to thrive in the Maw's sacred rumination.\" The sermon over, offerings are loaded into a crate and floated up to the very top of the temple, weighted down, and then pushed out into open water, to fall eventually down into the belly of the Maw. For an instant, a vision overcomes you: you are swimming through the open Zee, dwarfing creatures and reefs alike. The stars are visible through miles of water above. The vision is gone; you are left feeling suddenly, ludicrously small."
