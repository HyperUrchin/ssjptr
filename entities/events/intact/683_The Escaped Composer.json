When they saw that I was not bending, they offered me freedom if I would compose a special song for them. One that would sound less alien to human ears than Drownie music, but that would... create a longing for the cold and dark of the deep Zee. I did this, and they set me free.\r\n\r\n\"But since writing the song, I have not wanted to leave the Zee-floor. I have family in London, but it seems so far away, so loud and brightly lit... Better to stay here, where there is nothing to jangle up the melodies I am hearing in my mind.\""
