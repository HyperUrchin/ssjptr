But they are larger now, grown like oaks into the cavern floor. Their bodies are clear as lens-glass. Their faces are past the necessity of expression. They are your superiors, but you have come far enough that they are willing to help you if you wish. [Note that you can develop at most one of these areas. You will not be able to change your mind. Choose wisely.]",

He tells you distasteful facts that you do not like to accept. He tells you fearful facts that are difficult to imagine. He tells you convoluted facts that you can barely comprehend.\r\n\r\nBut in the end, your brain is a cultivated latticework, two enantiomorphic lobes through which you can diffract both truth and its opposite."
