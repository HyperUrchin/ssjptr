It burns almost as much as it aches.\r\n\r\nMemories rush back. The clap of the Pirate-Poet's hand on your shoulder as she described the aftermath of your last encounter. Her story of countless days spent fighting her way through the slime and stench of a zee-beast's stomach. Rescue by slavers, then shovelling coal until opportunity arose to escape... and then? \r\n\r\nThen, there was more. Now, just aching. All over, but mostly... there. Why there, of all places? A bandage. Is it a wound from an ill-judged duel? No, you recall... a parting gift, given with a smirk and a baptised with a loving splash of cheap whisky. You peel back the fabric. A tattoo.\r\n\r\nOh. Oh no."

Clay and flesh twist, grapple, entwine; an advantage pressed, a counter-attack enthusiastically welcomed. The smell of sweat. The taste of gunpowder. A few stolen minutes behind the Limpet that could never last long enough.\r\n\r\nThe Pirate-Poet pulls her hood back over her bald head. \"You have seen more of my poetry than most now. Those... those are verses from another time. I carved them, but it was your city made them part of my clay. I keep them as a promise to myself, that never again will your people get to leave their marks upon me.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitates. \"But I will give you the chance, if you will do me the same honour.\""
