  "Description": "He meets you on the balcony of a shoreside coffee-house. His handshake is effusive. His smile and cummerbund are broad. He urges you to squares of sticky baklava, and a tiny glass of black coffee sweetened with a sprig of mint.\r\n\r\n\"I trust you won't mind answering a few questions?\" He asks, opening a notebook. \"To ensure we're on the same page, so to speak.\" The interview is scandalously personal. What business has he to ask such things?",

Knowing you as well as I do now,\" he studies his notebook, too embarrassed to meet your eye, \"I think we can do business.\" [You may accept the Broker's Commission in Adam's Way.]"
