        "Description": "Blue Prophets cry the names of those about to die. This morning, the name they cried was yours. At noon, your Chief Engineer begins to pace the deck, chanting in the tongues of the Elder Continent. He refuses to return below. At four o'clock by the ship's chronometer, the ship begins to speak to you. It apologises for what will happen next. Only you can hear it. At seven o'clock, the engine bursts like a heart. The hull shatters. You are lost in the tides of the Mountain's Blood, stained and avid. Your bones will grow in the muds of the river's shore."
