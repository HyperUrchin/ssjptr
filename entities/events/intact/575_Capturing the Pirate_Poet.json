For now at least, there is no escape. The Modiste directs the crew to clamp the ship's heaviest irons around her wrists. The Pirate-Poet causes no trouble as she is led to the brig. Her sword is confiscated and placed in storage."

A crewman quickly meets its blade. It takes several more minor injuries before the others finally subdue her, but she is outnumbered and has nowhere to go. She accepts her defeat, submitting to the heavy iron shackles. The sword is put in storage."
